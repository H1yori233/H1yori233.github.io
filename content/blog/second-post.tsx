            In this article, we'll explore some advanced features and best practices for building static blogs with Next.js.
          </p>
          
          <h2>1. Image Optimization</h2>
          <p>
            Next.js provides built-in image optimization that automatically compresses, resizes, and converts images to the most efficient formats.
            This is crucial for improving page load speed and user experience.
          </p>
          
          <h2>2. Code Splitting</h2>
          <p>
            Next.js automatically splits your code and only loads the JavaScript needed for the current page.
            This significantly improves first-load performance, especially for large applications.
          </p>
          
          <h2>3. Static Site Generation (SSG)</h2>
          <p>
            Using Next.js's SSG feature, you can pre-render all pages at build time, generating pure HTML files.
            This way, users can immediately access content when visiting your site, without waiting for server responses or client-side rendering.
          </p>
          
          <h2>4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)</h2>
          <p>
            While ISR cannot be used for completely static deployments (like GitHub Pages), it's a powerful Next.js feature.
            In supported environments, ISR allows you to periodically regenerate pages to keep content fresh while maintaining the advantages of static sites.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By leveraging these features, you can build fast and flexible static blogs while maintaining a convenient development experience.
